Overview of Project- Purpose
Louiseâ€™s play Fever just missed her Kickstarter fundraising goal of $2,885 by only $400. She ran her campaign for 28 days between June and July. Now Louise would like to know how other campaigns faired based on their goals and launch date. In our analysis of the Kickstarter data, we will take a deeper look at Theater campaigns and determine what factors such as the time of the year that a campaign is executed, and the amount of campaign goal played in successful Kickstarter campaigns. Our goal is to provide Louise with better insights to apply to her next Kickstarter campaign in an effort to be successful in future fundraising efforts.
The Creation Date of the Kickstarter campaigns dataset, we compared those time frames and if the campaign achieved its fundraising goal. Using pivot table, we can filter the data by Parent Category which allows us to look at all Theater projects within data set. Now we can look at the relation of successful and failed campaigns.

Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Working with a large dataset like Kickstarter, huge challenge was filtering the data making sure its understood and interpreted. Once filtered correctly. Several times the data did not reflect what we expected. We have to make several adjustments to the formula. We reviewed the formula and resolved the issues.
Results:
What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
In conclusion May and June are the best months to start a Kickstarter campaign. May and June had the most Plays campaign started. Which were the most successful. The data shows that May-August had the most campaigns started. Our chart clearly shows the trend where te campaign becoming less successful after June.
What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
We concluded that the campaign had goals less than $5000 were the most successful. More campaigns launched where goals were less than $5000.
What are some limitations of this dataset?
It would have been more eye opening if we had more data. Like what type of advertising and marketing for each campaign.This could have factored fails and successes.
What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
Within the filtering data, Play campaigns ran 30 days had the most success
Plays that ran 30 days had goals less than $5000
The data provided shows Plays campaign with Goals of Under $5000 of 30 days in Length Launched in May or June had the most success. Best practices would be to study this data for future campaigns.
